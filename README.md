<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>The idea is to make the comunication easier between people about their current status, if you are in a meeting or busy with something and they can't reach you out it's simple, with one click you can tell to another person. You and a friend could use the app to warning each other about the avaliability to go to other home or to play some game. Use your imagination, basically you can send a message just with a click in a button.</p>
